# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program. It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs. There are other topics covered such as weight intialization and batch normalization.

There are also notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program. In the program itself, the projects are reviewed by Udacity experts, but they are available here as well.

## Table Of Contents


### Projects

* [1. Predicting Bike Sharing Data](https://github.com/Kshitijkc/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/1.%20Predicting%20Bike%20Sharing%20Data): Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.
* [2. Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/Kshitijkc/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/2.%20Dog%20Breed%20Classifier): Built an algorithm to identify canine breed given an image of a dog. If given image of a human, the algorithm identifies a resembling dog breed.
* [3. Generate TV Scripts](https://github.com/Kshitijkc/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/3.%20Generate%20TV%20Scripts): Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.
* [4. Generate Faces](https://github.com/Kshitijkc/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/4.%20Generate%20Faces): Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)
* [5. Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly](https://github.com/Kshitijkc/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/5.%20Teach%20a%20Quadcopter%20How%20to%20Fly): In this project, you will design an agent that can fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice! Try to apply the techniques you have learnt in this module to find out what works best, but also feel free to come up with innovative ideas and test them.
