# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

This is the project done by me during this Nanodegree program.

This repository contains project related to my Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) program. It consists of a bunch of notebooks for various deep learning topics. The notebooks lead you through project done on various networks such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, GANs and Reinforcement Learning.

The projects has been reviewed by Udacity experts.

### Projects

* [1. Predicting Bike Sharing Data](https://github.com/Kshitijkc/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/1.%20Predicting%20Bike%20Sharing%20Data): Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.
* [2. Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/Kshitijkc/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/2.%20Dog%20Breed%20Classifier): Built an algorithm to identify canine breed given an image of a dog. If given image of a human, the algorithm identifies a resembling dog breed.
* [3. Generate TV Scripts](https://github.com/Kshitijkc/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/3.%20Generate%20TV%20Scripts): Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.
* [4. Generate Faces](https://github.com/Kshitijkc/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/4.%20Generate%20Faces): Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)
* [5. Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly](https://github.com/Kshitijkc/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/5.%20Teach%20a%20Quadcopter%20How%20to%20Fly): In this project, you will design an agent that can fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice! Try to apply the techniques you have learnt in this module to find out what works best, but also feel free to come up with innovative ideas and test them.
